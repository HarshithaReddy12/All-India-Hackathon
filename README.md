Todayâ€™s human effort is in the direction of how to make devices easier, safer, faster and more accurate, which is the source of the emergence of more precise electronic systems. Sensors are now a vital part of any modern automobile design, serving many different purposes. They are instrumental in helping car manufactures to bring models to market that are safer, more fuel efficient and more comfortable to drive. Over time, sensors will also enable greater degrees of vehicle automation, which the industry will benefit from. Our main aim is to detect potholes, speed breakers or vehicles present at a certain distance using a camera which records images or videos while parking or while driving on uneven areas to avoid accidents. Sensors will detect them at a specified distance and sends an alert to the driver so as to control the speed of the vehicle. Thus, preventing accidents.
